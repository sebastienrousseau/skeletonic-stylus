## Getting Started

[The Skeletonic Stylus library](https://skeletonic.app) is a [Stylus](https://github.com/stylus/stylus) Open Source code library built for the [Skeletonic CSS](https://skeletonic.app) framework.

### Local Setup

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/skeletonic/archive/v1.2.1.zip)
- Install with [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skeletonic) to get the pre-built CSS and sourcemaps. This is recommended when using Skeletonic for a typical web project: ```npm install skeletonic```
- Install with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/skeletonic) to get the pre-built CSS and sourcemaps. This is recommended when using Skeletonic for a typical web project: ```yarn add skeletonic```
- Clone the main repository to get all source files including build scripts: `git clone https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/skeletonic.git`

## What's included

Within the download you'll find all the source files, compiled and minified CSS bundles as well as the [CSS sourcemaps](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/source-maps) grouped into the *dist* folder.

You'll see something like this:

```text  
skeletonic-1.2.1
├── skeletonic-animations.css
├── skeletonic-animations.css.map
├── skeletonic-animations.min.css
├── skeletonic-colours.css
├── skeletonic-colours.css.map
├── skeletonic-colours.min.css
├── skeletonic-fonts.css
├── skeletonic-fonts.css.map
├── skeletonic-fonts.min.css
├── skeletonic-pattern.css
├── skeletonic-pattern.css.map
├── skeletonic-pattern.min.css
├── skeletonic.css
├── skeletonic.css.map
└── skeletonic.min.css
```

Now simply link one of these CSS in your HTML document. In that case, the quickest and easiest way to start using skeletonic is to include a reference to the minified CSS file.

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="skeletonic.min.css" />`

The link consists of just a simple line of HTML code that you will need to put in the ```<head>```  section of your HTML document.

We also provide production-ready versions and use **[unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)** as our preferred CDN to link to the latest production version. **[unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)** is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on npm.  

Please feel free to grab the latest:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/skeletonic/dist/skeletonic.min.css" />`

You can also specify a specific version as per below. The latest version as of today is 1.2.1.

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/skeletonic@1.2.1/dist/skeletonic.min.css" />`

## Extend

We provide a growing library of extensible CSS module files, utilities, themes and components ready to use as is to fit your web needs.

### CSS Responsive Grid-View

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="skeletonic-pattern.min.css" />`

### CSS Colours

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="skeletonic-colours.min.css" />`
