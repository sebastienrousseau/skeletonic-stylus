  // Default animation setup
  // .spin,
  // .bounce,
  // .chameleonbackground,
  // .chameleontext
  //   animation-duration: 6000ms
  //   animation-direction: normal
  //   animation-iteration-count: infinite
  //   animation-timing-function: linear

  // The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
  // All iterations of the animation are played in the reverse direction from the way they were specified. When an animation is played in reverse the timing functions are also reversed.
  .reverse
    animation-direction: reverse

  // The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
  // The animation cycle iterations that are odd counts are played in the normal direction, and the animation cycle iterations that are even counts are played in a reverse direction, thus reversing direction each cycle.
  .alternate
    animation-direction: reverse

  // The animation is played backwards first, then forwards
  // The animation cycle iterations that are odd counts are played in the reverse direction, and the animation cycle iterations that are even counts are played in a normal direction, again reversing direction each cycle.
  .alternate-reverse
    animation-direction: alternate-reverse
